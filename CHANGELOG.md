- **Agent Engine**:
  - Add AIAgentPipeline interceptors to uniformly handle node errors; propagate `NodeExecutionError` across features ([KG-170](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KG-170)).
  - Include finish node processing in the pipeline to ensure finalizers run reliably (#598).
- **File Tools and RAG**:
    - Reworked FileSystemProvider with API cleanups and better ergonomics; moved blocking/suspendable operations to `Dispatchers.IO` for improved performance and responsiveness (#557, “Move suspendable operations to Dispatchers.IO”).
    - Introduce `filterByRoot` helpers and allow custom path filters in `FilteredFileSystemProvider` for safer agent sandboxes (#494, #508).
    - Rename `PathFilter` to `TraversalFilter` and make its methods suspendable to support async checks.
    - Rename `fromAbsoluteString` to `fromAbsolutePathString` for clarity (#567).
    - Add `ReadFileTool` for reading local file contents where appropriate (#628).
